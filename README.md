# Mining MOOC Discussion Forums #

The MOOC Mining Project is an ongoing data mining initiative directed towards
the discussion forums of massively open online courses. Our motivation to
discover insights into the dynamics of these courses is three-fold; we wish to:

1. better understand the educational and learning process,
2. improve the educational environment for MOOC learners, and
3. empower instructors by equipping them with a suite of tools designed to
   ease the burden of teaching large-scale classes.

We focus our efforts on the [Stanford MOOC-Posts
dataset](http://datastage.stanford.edu/StanfordMoocPosts/ "MOOC-Posts"), a
publicly available dataset that was created to enable the MOOC Mining Project.
