# Mining MOOC Discussion Forums #

The MOOC Mining Project is an ongoing data mining initiative directed towards
the discussion forums of massively open online courses. Our motivation to
discover insights into the dynamics of these courses is three-fold; we wish to:

1. better understand the educational and learning process,
2. improve the educational environment for MOOC learners, and
3. empower instructors by letting them put their fingers on the pulses of their
   courses and by providing them with a suite of tools that lighten the burden
   of teaching large scale classes.

In particular, the project mines MOOC discussion forums. We focus
our efforts on the [Stanford MOOC-Posts
dataset](http://datastage.stanford.edu/StanfordMoocPosts/ "MOOC-Posts"), which
was created for this project; the dataset is now publicly available to the research
community.
