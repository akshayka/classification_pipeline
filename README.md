# Mining MOOC Discussion Forums #

The MOOC mining project is an attempt to uncover insights into the
dynamics of massiviely open online courses in order to 1) better understand
the online educational domain and 2) build systems that improve the learning
environment. In particular, the project mining MOOC discussion forums. We focus
our efforts on the [Stanford MOOC-Posts
dataset](http://datastage.stanford.edu/StanfordMoocPosts/ "MOOC-Posts"), which
was created for this project and is now publicly available to the research
community.
